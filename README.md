# Eurostat Crime 2021 Dataset Analysis 📊

This project entails a comprehensive analysis of the EurostatCrime2021 dataset, which records offences by offence category in 41 European countries in 2021. The tasks involved in this analysis are outlined below:

### Task 1: Data Manipulation
1. **Loading the Dataset:** 📂 The dataset EurostatCrime2021.xlsx was loaded into R, ensuring that missing values represented by ":" were handled appropriately.
2. **Dataset Structure:** 📋 The size (number of rows and columns) and structure of the dataset were determined.
3. **Column Removal:** ❌ Columns for Fraud and Money laundering, which contained no data, were removed.
4. **Standardization of Categories:** 📝 To facilitate comparison across countries, columns related to theft and burglary were standardized.
5. **Calculation of Overall Offences:** ➕ A new column containing the overall record of offences for each country (per hundred thousand inhabitants) was added.
6. **Handling Missing Data:** 🚫 Countries with missing data were identified and listed, and subsequently removed from the dataset.
7. **New Dataset Summary:** 📊 The number of observations and variables in the new dataset was determined.

### Task 2: Data Analysis
1. **Highest Offences:** 🥇 The country with the highest overall record of offences in 2021 (per hundred thousand inhabitants) was identified.
2. **Proportion of Crimes:** 🔍 A table displaying the countries and the proportion of overall crimes due to acts against computer systems was generated, sorted in ascending order.
3. **Relationship Visualization:** 📈 A plot showing the relationship between robbery and unlawful acts involving controlled drugs or precursors was created, with improved aesthetics.
